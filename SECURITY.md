## How to Report a Vulnerability or a Bug

Users sometimes find a vulnerability or a bug. In that case, please send an e-mail to me as soon as you can. (In the case of vulnerability, don't tell to other person.)
Then I will stop sharing and I start debugging. After that, I will send you a message about finishing debugs and I will appreciate it.
